This file ONLY applies to the code found in the "aimsChain" directory
and below.

The code in the "aimsChain" subdirectory is distributed under the 
Lesser General Public License (LGPL), Version 3, 29 June 2007 as found at
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html and chosen by the developers of
the Atomic Simulation Environment.

Part of this code is modified python code by Yingu Yao which originated
within the Atomic Simulation Environment. Yingyu's code is also
available to anyone at his separate Github repository, independent of
FHI-aims, and respecting the original license. 

We want to make it absolutely clear that we only choose to include the
"aimsChain" code in this directory here for the convenience of
FHI-aims users. We are not interested in violating anyone's license
and we are not interested in keeping the code secret or hidden. 

All the code in the "aimsChain" directory comes under the LGPL . It is
python code and does not link directly to any of the FHI-aims source
code elsewhere in this distribution. We thus believe that we are in
compliance with the LGPL both in fact and in spirit.
